# **ARCADE BATTLE (CLIENT + REST API)**

**Arcade Battle**: A project that consists of a set of arcade games to help patients with arthritis to the extent that it can motivate patients to do the exercises intended by the doctor in a game environment.

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
* **Django Models**: We used django models to create and model entities into a database. Regarding entity relations, we implemented N:M and N:1 relations;
* **Django Forms**: We implemented all the forms of our web application using Django Forms, since they provide an easier way of accessing data;
* **Django Authentication**: The mechanisms provided by Django Authentication were widely used to allow different users to log in into your web application;
* **Django Authorization**: We decided to delimit the areas that each user had access to. This being said, we use Django Authorization mechanisms to make sure that only the allowed users could perform certain operations. For instance, a doctor can only see other doctors, but cannot remove them from the system. Such operation can only be done by an admin.
* **Django REST Framework**: The mechanisms provided by Django REST Framework allow the creation of a REST API;

##### EXTRA FEATURES
*  **Django Core Mail**: In our application, the users aren't abble to register themselves. For a user to be register into the system, it is mandatory that this is user is added by a doctor (can add patients) or by an admin (can add admins, doctors and patients). The new user will have to provide a valid e-mail address and a password will be sent to this e-mail, allowing the user to access the application.
*  **Integration with Leap Motion (www.leapmotion.com)**: Our system integrates the Leap Motion SDK, which allows the recording of a gesture (to be executed by a patient) and its persistance in the database. We save the image and the decision tree associated with each gesture, so that, we can evaluate if a patient is executing correctly a gesture.

## CONFIGURATION

### 1. On API's Project:
| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Get inside of the venv directory | `. venv/bin/activate` |
| Install dependencies | `pip3 install djangorestframework==3.7.7` ;  `pip3 install requests` ; `pip3 install django` ;  `pip install mysqlclient`|

### 2. MySQL Databse
On Ubuntu:
| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install MySQL | `apt install mysql-server` |
| Access MySQL  as admin | `mysql -u root -p` (default password: _root_)|
| Create the database | `REATE DATABASE arcadebattle_db;`|
| Create a new user and set it's password | `CREATE USER 'arcadebattle'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'arcadebattle';`|
| Create the database | `CREATE DATABASE arcadebattle_db;`|
| Grant priviliges to the new user | `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON arcadebattle_db. * TO 'arcadebattle'@'localhostâ€™;`|
| Create the database | `REATE DATABASE arcadebattle_db;`|
| Find out the port where MySQL is running | `SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';`|

After this steps, we will need to configure our REST API to access the new database we just created. For doing so, in `settings.py`file of the REST API Django Project we need to add the following code:
``` python
# Connect to external database
DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': '<db_name>',                        #arcadebattle_db
            'USER': "<user_name>",                      #arcadebattle
            'PASSWORD': "<pw_for_user>",                #arcadebattle
            'HOST': "<host>",                           #localhost
            'PORT': "<db_port>",                        #3306
        }
    }
```

Now, we have connected our REST API to our database. The only thing that's missing is to create the tables that will have the information we need. To create this tables, on the REST API Django Project we need to execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
It is advised to create a Django Admin that can be accessed on a browser, trough `<host>:<port>/admin`.
For this, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Ex:
* Username: _admin_
* Email: _admin@ua.pt_
* Password: _adminadmin_

We are almost ready to deploy this REST API, we are only missing a minor detail. We should configure in which port this API will be accessible.
To do this, in `manage.py` we need to add the following lines:

```python
from django.core.management.commands.runserver import Command as runserver
runserver.default_port = "<port>"   #9000
```

### 3. On Client's Project:
| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Get inside of the venv directory | `. venv/bin/activate` |
| Install dependencies | `pip3 install djangorestframework==3.7.7` ;  `pip3 install requests` ; `pip3 install django` |

Now, we can set a variable to indicate where the API is deployed, which will make requests to this API a lot easier.
In `settings.py`add the following variable:

```python
API_URL = '<url>'       #http://127.0.0.1:9000/
```
And then, in `views.py`, after importing this variable, we can make requests such as:
```python
result = requests.get(API_URL + "all_doctors", headers={'Authorization': 'Token ' + request.session["user_token"]})
```

### 4. Testing

First of all, deploys the Django Projects:
1. Deploy the REST API (`pyhton manage.py runserver`)
2. Deploy the Client's Project (`pyhton manage.py runserver`)

On [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/):

1. Execute a POST to `<API_url>/login` where the body (form-data) has the a _username_ and a _password_. If the authentication is succeeded, you will receive a JSON containing an _authentication token_;
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/BrOdRKR.png "")

2. Execute a GET to `<API_url>/reload_database` where the Header has a key=Authorization and the value=Token <token_id>. This will invoke a method on the API that will create some entities for testing;

3. Execute a GET to `<API_url>/all_people` where the Header has a key=Authorization and the value=Token <token_id>. If everything is working correctly, you should receive a JSON with information about all the people in the database.

### 5. REGARDING AUTHENTICATION

The user, when trying to request data trough the API, will have to authenticate himself into the API provided. Once the user authenticates himself into the API, he will receive an _authentication token_ that will be stored during the entire session. After this, to get information through the API, the user will have to send his _authentication token_ along with the request we wants ti make. Once the user logs out, this _token_ will be removed from the API authentiation database.

In our API, it is mandatory that the user first authenticate himself before making requests.

We need to add the following lines to the API's `settings.py`file:

```python
# Rest properties
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated', )
}
```

### 6. REGARDING SENDING EMAILS
To do so, we have to add the following information to the API's `settings.py`file:
``` python
# For sending emails:
EMAIL_HOST = '<smtp>'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = '<email>'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '<email_password>'
EMAIL_PORT = <port_on_smtp>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = <True|False>
```
